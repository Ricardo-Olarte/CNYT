# Complex Calculator

The complex calculator helps you if you need some answer in the complex number.
This calculator allows sum, multiplication, division, module, phase, conversion
form polar to cartesian and cartesian to polar, also you can will use for vector and
matrix like sum of matrix, matrix norm, conjugate matruz, tensor matrix and other
oparations.

# How can use it?

You need download the file's name "LibComplex", it is in my repository. In the file, its a folder,
into it you can see some files, we need open "libcplx.py" & "libopvcmtrz.py" because there are
the calculator for operations. Some funtions return matrix, others vectors, other complex numbers or
real numbers, and others return tuples.

Below some examples:

# Test

If you need only see the answer, you should open the file "TestLibComplex.py" and see if the calculator
works correctly.
